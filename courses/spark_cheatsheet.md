# Design Best Practices

	- Focus on a solid use case: focus on a specific goal or task
	- Make it social: Consider multiple faces support
	- Design for different device types: test on multiple mobile devices
	- Design for repeat use: make effects flexible
	- Keep it simple: clear instructions, one or two main interactions
	- Add to the camera experience: keep things recognizable
	- Avoid the edges of the screen: they can be obscured by UI
	- Amount of effort: make main features happen as soon as possible
	- Keep interactions obvious: e.g., pinching changes objects size
	- Avoid system-level command gestures:
		• Switch camera view - double tap.
		• Camera zoom - pinch in/out (except when resizing stickers or 3D objects).
		• Video zoom - touch and hold camera capture button then drag up.
		• Return to Facebook News Feed - swipe left.
	- Be mindful of accessibility concerns: no flashing lights
