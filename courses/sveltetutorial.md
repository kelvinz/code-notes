# introduction



## basics

similar to javascript frameworks like react, vue
except it converts the app at build time
while other frameworks runs/interprets commands at runtime
thus able to ship components as standalone packages that work anywhere
without a framework dependency



## adding data

```html

	<script>
		let name = 'world'
	</script>

	<h1>Hello { name }!</h1>
	<h1>Hello { name.toUpperCase() }!</h1>

;```
