# Making the Zombie Factory



## Making the Zombie 

The uint data type is an unsigned integer, meaning its value must be non-negative.
There's also an int data type for signed integers.

Note: In Solidity, uint is actually an alias for uint256, a 256-bit unsigned integer. You can declare uints with less bits — uint8, uint16, uint32, etc.. But in general you want to simply use uint except in specific cases, which we'll talk about in later lessons.

```solidity

pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract ZombieFactory {

	event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna);

	uint dnaDigits = 16;
	uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits;

	struct Zombie {
        string name;
        uint dna;
    }

    Zombie[] public zombies;

    function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) private {
        uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna)) - 1;
        emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna);
    }

    function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) {
        uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str)));
        return rand % dnaModulus;
    }

    function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {
        uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);
        _createZombie(_name, randDna);
    }

}

```

## Zombies Attack Their Victims

```solidity

pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract ZombieFactory {

    event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna);

    uint dnaDigits = 16;
    uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits;

    struct Zombie {
        string name;
        uint dna;
    }

    Zombie[] public zombies;

    mapping (uint => address) public zombieToOwner;
    mapping (address => uint) ownerZombieCount;

    function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) internal {
        uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna)) - 1;
        zombieToOwner[id] = msg.sender;
        ownerZombieCount[msg.sender]++;
        emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna);
    }

    function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) {
        uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str)));
        return rand % dnaModulus;
    }

    function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {
        require(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0);
        uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);
        _createZombie(_name, randDna);
    }

}

```

Storage refers to variables stored permanently on the blockchain. Memory variables are temporary, and are erased between external function calls to your contract. Think of it like your computer's hard disk vs RAM.

Most of the time you don't need to use these keywords because Solidity handles them by default. State variables (variables declared outside of functions) are by default storage and written permanently to the blockchain, while variables declared inside functions are memory and will disappear when the function call ends.

```solidity

pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

import "./zombiefactory.sol";

contract KittyInterface {
  function getKitty(uint256 _id) external view returns (
    bool isGestating,
    bool isReady,
    uint256 cooldownIndex,
    uint256 nextActionAt,
    uint256 siringWithId,
    uint256 birthTime,
    uint256 matronId,
    uint256 sireId,
    uint256 generation,
    uint256 genes
  )
}

contract ZombieFeeding is ZombieFactory {

    address ckAddress = 0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d;
    KittyInterface kittyContract = KittyInterface(ckAddress);

    function feedAndMultiply(uint _zombieId, uint _targetDna, string memory _species) public {
        require(msg.sender == zombieToOwner[_zombieId]);
        Zombie storage myZombie = zombies[_zombieId];

        _targetDna = _targetDna % dnaModulus;
        uint newDna = (myZombie.dna + _targetDna) / 2;

        if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_species)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("kitty"))) {
            newDna = newDna - newDna % 100 + 99;
        }

        _createZombie("NoName", newDna);
    }

    function feedOnKitty(uint _zombieId, uint _kittyId) public {
        uint kittyDna;
        (,,,,,,,,,kittyDna) = kittyContract.getKitty(_kittyId);

        feedAndMultiply(_zombieId, kittyDna, "kitty");
    }

}


```




## Advanced Solidity Concepts

After you deploy a contract to Ethereum, it’s immutable, which means that it can never be modified or updated again.

The initial code you deploy to a contract is there to stay, permanently, on the blockchain. This is one reason security is such a huge concern in Solidity. If there's a flaw in your contract code, there's no way for you to patch it later. You would have to tell your users to start using a different smart contract address that has the fix.

But this is also a feature of smart contracts. The code is law. If you read the code of a smart contract and verify it, you can be sure that every time you call a function it's going to do exactly what the code says it will do. No one can later change that function and give you unexpected results.
