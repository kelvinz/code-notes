# genes



## definitions

evolution
:	the change in allele frequencies in a population over time



allele
:	variant of a gene in population
:	expressed as a fraction or percentage



hardy weinberg principle
:	allele frequencies in population remains constant
:	from generation to generation
:	in the absence of evolutionary influences
:	in infinite population sizes



evolutionary influences

1.	natural selection
2.	genetic drift
3.	migration
4.	mutation

+	mate choice
+	assortative mating
+	sexual selection
+	gene flow
+	meiotic drive
+	genetic hitchhiking
+	population bottleneck
+	founder effect
+	inbreeding



diploid
:	each cell has two copies of genetic material

haploid
:	each cell has one copy of genetic material
