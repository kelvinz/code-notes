# Power of the Main Lockup

	- main headline
	- sub headline
	- main call to action
	- grouped together => sell, what, action

# Importance of One Main CTA

	- don't confuse user's first glance

# End with an Action

	- sums up your story
	- buy now, go to another page, newsletter, even back to top is good
	- as designers it's our job to direct users on what to do

# Consistent in EVERY View

	- buttons should look similar, shape, color, caps, etc
	- copy too, if there are too many variation of a action, users need to ask, which should I click
	- feeling to users that something is not right
	- use a design system

# Typography Musts

	- content is king, thus typography is king
	- kill widow words, it's calling unwanted attention to words, copy tweak, code tweak, margin tweak
	- subtext contrast, make it easy to read
