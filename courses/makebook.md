# TL;DR

## ðŸ’¡ Idea
Get an idea from problems in your own life.
If you don't have problems that are original enough, become a more original person.
Don't build products that are solutions in search of a problem.

## ðŸ›  Build
Build your idea with the tools you already know.
Don't spend a year learning some language you'll never use.
Don't outsource building to other people, that's a competitive disadvantage.
Build only the core functionality.
The rest comes later.

## ðŸš€ Launch
