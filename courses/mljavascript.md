# what is machine learning



## problem solving process

1.	identify the independent & dependent variables
	*features* - are categories of data points that affect the value of a label

2.	assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
	datasets almost always require cleanup or formatting

3.	decide on the type of output you are predicting
	*classification* - labels belong to a discret set
	*regression* - labels belong to a continuous set

4.	based on type of output,
	pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your 'feature' & 'labels'
	many algorithms exist, each with pros & cons

5.	use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction
	models relate the value of 'features' to the value of 'labels'

# algorithm overview



## k-nearest neighbor ( knn )

one of the simplest machine learning algorithms
essentially averaging the most similar inputs previously & their results

*eg. which bucket will a ball go into if dropped at 300px*

-	drop a ball a bunch of times all around the board
-	for each observation, subtract drop point from 300px to get absolute value
-	sort the results from least to most
-	look at the 'k' top records, what was the most frequent bucket
-	the more frequent bucket is our prediction

*note: k is a generic number which can be experimented & adjusted to suit different tasks*
