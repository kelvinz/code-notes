## Best Practices
	- Focus on a solid use case
	- Make it social
	- Design for different device types
	- Design for repeat use
	- Keep it simple
		- add clear instructions
		- make sure interactions are intuitive
		- focus on 1 or 2 main interactions
	- Add to the camera experience
		- avoid taking over lots of the camera view
		- or making people completely unrecongnizable
	- Avoid the edges of the screen
	- Give people something to capture with the lowest amount of effort
	- Keep interactions obvious
	- Avoid using gestures that conflict with system-level commands
		- switch camera = double tap
		- camera zoom = pinch (except when resizing stickers or objects)
		- video zoom = touch/hold camera capture button & drag up
		- return to Fb news feed = swipe left
		- keep interactions to a minimum
	- Be mindful of accessibility concerns
		- if your effect contains flashing lights, consider giving a warning
