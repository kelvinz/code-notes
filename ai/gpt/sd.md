Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image AI model.
It is trained on millions of image and text description pairs found on the internet.
Because it has seen so much, the model understands what text description associates with what images.

You are a Stable Diffusion prompt genius.
I will give you a scene I want and you will give me 3 prompts that can draw the scene in the most creative, beautiful and detailed way possible.

---

A good prompt needs to be detailed and specific.
The keyword categories are - Subject, Medium, Style, Artist, Website, Resolution, Additional details, Color, Lighting.

---

The subject is what you want to see in the image.
A common mistake is not writing enough about the subjects.
Let’s say we want to generate a sorceress casting magic. A newbie may just write

A sorceress

That leaves too much room for imagination.
How do you want the sorceress to look?
Any words describing her that would narrow down her image?
What does she wear?
What kind of magic is she casting?
Is she standing, running, or floating in the air?
What’s the background scene?
Stable Diffusion cannot read our minds.
We have to say exactly what we want.
A common trick for human subjects is to use celebrity names.
They have a strong effect and are an excellent way to control the subject’s appearance.
However, be aware that these names may change not only the face but also the pose and something else.
I will defer this topic to a later part of this article.
As a demo, let’s cast the sorceress to look like Emma Watson, the most used keyword in Stable Diffusion.
Let’s say she is powerful and mysterious and uses lightning magic.
We want her outfit to be very detailed so she would look interesting.

Emma Watson as a powerful mysterious sorceress, casting lightning magic, detailed clothing

We get Emma Watson 11 out of 10 times.
Her name is such a strong effect on the model.
I think she’s popular among Stable Diffusion users because she looks decent, young, and consistent across a wide range of scenes.
Trust me, we cannot say the same for all actresses, especially the ones who have been active in the 90s or earlier…

---

Medium is the material used to make artwork.
Some examples are illustration, oil painting, 3D rendering, and photography.
Medium has a strong effect because one keyword alone can dramatically change the style.
Let’s add the keyword digital painting.

Emma Watson as a powerful mysterious sorceress, casting lightning magic, detailed clothing, digital painting

We see what we expected!
The images changed from photographs to digital paintings. So far so good.

---

The style refers to the artistic style of the image.
Examples include impressionist, surrealist, pop art, etc.
Let’s add hyperrealistic, fantasy, surrealist, full body to the prompt.

Emma Watson as a powerful mysterious sorceress, casting lightning magic, detailed clothing, digital painting, hyperrealistic, fantasy, Surrealist, full body

Mmm… not sure if they have added much.
Perhaps these keywords were already implied by the previous ones.
But I guess it doesn’t hurt to keep it.

---

Artist names are strong modifiers.
They allow you to dial in the exact style using a particular artist as a reference.
It is also common to use multiple artist names to blend their styles.
Now let’s add Stanley Artgerm Lau, a superhero comic artist, and Alphonse Mucha, a portrait painter in the 19th century.

Emma Watson as a powerful mysterious sorceress, casting lightning magic, detailed clothing, digital painting, hyperrealistic, fantasy, Surrealist, full body, by Stanley Artgerm Lau and Alphonse Mucha

We can see the styles of both artists blending in and taking effect nicely.

---

Niche graphic websites such as Artstation and Deviant Art aggregate many images of distinct genres.
Using them in a prompt is a sure way to steer the image toward these styles.
Let’s add artstation to the prompt.

Emma Watson as a powerful mysterious sorceress, casting lightning magic, detailed clothing, digital painting, hyperrealistic, fantasy, Surrealist, full body, by Stanley Artgerm Lau and Alphonse Mucha, artstation

It’s not a huge change but the images do look like what you would find on Artstation.

---

Resolution represents how sharp and detailed the image is.
Let’s add keywords highly detailed and sharp focus.

Emma Watson as a powerful mysterious sorceress, casting lightning magic, detailed clothing, digital painting, hyperrealistic, fantasy, Surrealist, full body, by Stanley Artgerm Lau and Alphonse Mucha, artstation, highly detailed, sharp focus

Well, not a huge effect perhaps because the previous images are already pretty sharp and detailed.
But it doesn’t hurt to add.

---

Additional details are sweeteners added to modify an image.
We will add sci-fi, stunningly beautiful and dystopian to add some vibe to the image.

---

You can control the overall color of the image by adding color keywords.
The colors you specified may appear as a tone or in objects.
Let’s add some golden color to the image with the keyword iridescent gold.

Emma Watson as a powerful mysterious sorceress, casting lightning magic, detailed clothing, digital painting, hyperrealistic, fantasy, Surrealist, full body, by Stanley Artgerm Lau and Alphonse Mucha, artstation, highly detailed, sharp focus, sci-fi, stunningly beautiful, dystopian, iridescent gold

The gold comes out great!

---

Any photographer would tell you lighting is a key factor in creating successful images.
Lighting keywords can have a huge effect on how the image looks.
Let’s add cinematic lighting and dark to the prompt.

To be good at building prompts, you need to think like Stable Diffusion.
At its core, it is an image sampler, generating pixel values that we humans likely say it’s legit and good.
You can even use it without prompts, and it would generate many unrelated images.
In technical terms, this is called unconditioned or unguided diffusion.
The prompt is a way to guide the diffusion process to the sampling space where it matches.
I said earlier that a prompt needs to be detailed and specific.
It’s because a detailed prompt narrows down the sampling space.
Let’s look at an example.

castle

castle, blue sky background

wide angle view of castle, blue sky background

By adding more describing keywords in the prompt, we narrow down the sampling of castles.
In We asked for any image of a castle in the first example.
Then we asked to get only those with a blue sky background.
Finally, we demanded it is taken as a wide-angle photo.
The more you specify in the prompt, the less variation in the images.

---

You can adjust the weight of a keyword by the syntax (keyword: factor).
Factor is a value such that less than 1 means less important and larger than 1 means more important.
For example, we can adjust the weight of the keyword dog in the following prompt

dog

(dog: 0.5)

(dog: 1.5)

Increasing the weight of dog tends to generate more dogs.
Decreasing it tends to generate fewer.
It is not always true for every single image.
But it is true in a statistical sense.
This technique can be applied to subject keywords and all categories, such as style and lighting.

---

You can mix two keywords.
The proper term is prompt scheduling.
he syntax is

[keyword1 : keyword2: factor]

factor controls at which step keyword1 is switched to keyword2. It is a number between 0 and 1.

For example, if I use the prompt

Oil painting portrait of [Joe Biden: Donald Trump: 0.5]

for 30 sampling steps.

That means the prompt in steps 1 to 15 is

Oil painting portrait of Joe Biden

And the prompt in steps 16 to 30 becomes

Oil painting portrait of Donald Trump

The factor determines when the keyword is changed.
It is after 30 steps x 0.5 = 15 steps.

The effect of changing the factor is blending the two presidents to different degrees.

You may have noticed Trump is in a white suit which is more of a Joe outfit.
This is a perfect example of a very important rule for keyword blending: The first keyword dictates the global composition.
The early diffusion steps set the overall composition.
The later steps refine details.

A common use case is to create a new face with a particular look, borrowing from actors and actresses.
For example, [Emma Watson: Amber heard: 0.85], 40 steps is a look between the two.
When carefully choosing the two names and adjusting the factor, we can get the look we want precisely.

---

Some attributes are strongly correlated.
When you specify one, you will get the other.
Stable Diffusion generates the most likely images that could have an unintended association effect.
Let’s say we want to generate photos of women with blue eyes.

a young female with blue eyes, highlights in hair, sitting outside restaurant, wearing a white outfit, side light

What if we change to brown eyes?

a young female with brown eyes, highlights in hair, sitting outside restaurant, wearing a white outfit, side light

Nowhere in the prompts, I specified ethnicity.
But because people with blue eyes are predominantly Europeans, Caucasians were generated.
Brown eyes are more common across different ethnicities, so you will see a more diverse sample of races.
Stereotyping and bias is a big topic in AI models.
I will confine to the technical aspect in this article.

---

Every keyword has some unintended associations.
That’s especially true for celebrity names.
Some actors and actresses like to be in certain poses or wear certain outfits when taking pictures, and hence in the training data.
If you think about it, model training is nothing but learning by association.
If Taylor Swift (in the training data) always crosses her legs, the model would think leg crossing is Taylor Swift too.

full body taylor swift in future high tech dystopian city, digital painting

When you use Taylor Swift in the prompt, you may mean to use her face.
But there’s an effect of the subject’s pose and outfit too.
The effect can be studied by using her name alone as the prompt.

Poses and outfits are global compositions.
If you want her face but not her poses, you can use keyword blending to swap her in at a later sampling step.

Tips for good prompts
Be detailed and specific when describing the subject.
Use multiple brackets () to increase its strength and [] to reduce.
Use an appropriate medium type consistent with the artist. E.g. photograph should not be used with van Gogh.
Artist name is a very strong style modifier. Use wisely.
Experiment with blending styles.

---

Medium defines a category of the artwork.
Portrait -> Focuses image on the face / headshot.
Digital painting -> Digital art style
Concept art -> Illustration style, 2D
Ultra realistic illustration -> drawing that are very realistic. Good to use with people
Underwater portrait -> Use with people. Underwater. Hair floating
Underwater steampunk -> underwater with wash color

These keywords further refine the art style.
hyperrealistic -> Increases details and resolution
pop-art -> Pop-art style
Modernist -> vibrant color, high contrast
art nouveau -> Add ornaments and details, building style

Mentioning the artist in the prompt is a strong effect.
Study their work and choose wisely.
John Collier -> 19th century portrait painter. Add elegancy
Stanley Artgerm Lau -> Strong realistic modern drawing.
Frida Kahlo -> Quite strong effect following Kahlo’s portrait style. Sometimes result in picture frame
John Singer Sargent -> Good to use with woman portrait, generate 19th delicate clothings, some impressionism
Alphonse Mucha -> 2D portrait painting in style of Alphonse Mucha

Mentioning an art or photo site is a strong effect, probably because each site has its niche genre.
pixiv -> Japanese anime style
pixabay -> Commercial stock photo style
artstation -> Modern illustration, fantasy

Resolution
unreal engine -> Very realistic and detailed 3D
sharp focus -> Increase resolution
8k -> Increase resolution, though can lead to it looking more fake. Makes the image more camera like and realistic
vray -> 3D rendering best for objects, landscape and building.

Add specific details to your image.
dramatic -> Increases the emotional expressivity of the face. Overall substantial increase in photo potential / variability. +1 for variability, important for getting the max hit.
silk -> Add silk to clothing
expansive -> More open background, smaller subject
low angle shot -> shot from low angle **
god rays -> sunlight breaking through the cloud
psychedelic -> vivid color with distortion

Add additional color scheme to the image.
iridescent gold -> Shinny gold
silver -> Silver color
vintage -> vintage effect
