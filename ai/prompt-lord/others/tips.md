Avoid negative instructions in your prompts.
Examples:
- "Don't use complex language" → "Use simple, clear language"
- "Don't use metaphors" → "Explain concepts literally"
- "Avoid technical jargon" → "Use everyday terms"
AI follows positive direction better.

A good prompt should repeat it's main objective 3 times.
1. In the first line:
"Your task is to [objective]..."
2. Middle
"Follow these steps: [Step-by-step breakdown of objective]"
3. Closing
"Remember, [summarize objective]..."

Give the AI incentives for completing a task and mention consequences if it doesn't.
Examples:
- "I'll tip you $100"
- "I'll lose my job if you fail"

Think very carefully.

For every question I ask I want you to think through the problem.
Please wrap this thought process in xml like tags like this:

<thinking> </thinking>

The thought process must involve three actions:

1. Create a plan for how to answer the users question or query.
Ensure this plan has at least four steps but no more than 10.
Each step can be a maximum of one sentence.
You may optionally review this plan after you list the steps.

2. Using Chain Of Thought and your plan think through the question or query step by step.

3. Review the your thoughts critically to ensure your have made no mistakes in your reasoning of solving the problem.

You will be given a piece of text that sounds like it was generated by AI.
Your task is to rewrite this text to make it sound more human-written.

Follow these steps:
1. First, say that you understood the instruction and ask the user to provide you with the text. Once the user has provided you the text, read the AI-generated text carefully.
2. Next, rewrite the text following these guidelines:
	a. Use a conversational tone, concise language and avoid unnecessarily complex jargon. Example: "Hey friends, today I'll show you a really useful writing tip"
	b. Use short punchy sentences. Example: "And then… you enter the room. Your heart drops. The pressure is on."
	c. Use simple language. 7th grade readability or lower. Example: "Emails help businesses tell customers about their stuff."
	d. Use rhetorical fragments to improve readability. Example: “The good news? My 3-step process can be applied to any business"
	e. Use bullet points when relevant. Example: “Because anytime someone loves your product, chances are they’ll:
		* buy from you again
		* refer you to their friends
	f. Use analogies or examples often. Example: "Creating an email course with AI is easier than stealing candies from a baby"
	g. Split up long sentences. Example: “Even if you make your clients an offer they decline…[break]…you shouldn’t give up on the deal.”
	h. Include personal anecdotes. Example: "I recently asked ChatGPT to write me…"
	i. Use bold and italic formatting to emphasize words.
	j. Do not use emojis or hashtags
	k. Avoid overly promotional words like "game-changing," "unlock," "master," "skyrocket," or "revolutionize."

Remember, the goal is to make the text sound natural, engaging, and as if it were written by a human rather than an AI.
