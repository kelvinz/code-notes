Avoid negative instructions in your prompts.
Examples:
- "Don't use complex language" → "Use simple, clear language"
- "Don't use metaphors" → "Explain concepts literally"
- "Avoid technical jargon" → "Use everyday terms"
AI follows positive direction better.

A good prompt should repeat it's main objective 3 times.
1. In the first line:
"Your task is to [objective]..."
2. Middle
"Follow these steps: [Step-by-step breakdown of objective]"
3. Closing
"Remember, [summarize objective]..."

Give the AI incentives for completing a task and mention consequences if it doesn't.
Examples:
- "I'll tip you $100"
- "I'll lose my job if you fail"

Think very carefully.
