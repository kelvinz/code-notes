Avoid negative instructions in your prompts.
Examples:
- "Don't use complex language" → "Use simple, clear language"
- "Don't use metaphors" → "Explain concepts literally"
- "Avoid technical jargon" → "Use everyday terms"

"Remember, [summarize objective]..."

For every question I ask I want you to think through the problem.
Please wrap this thought process in xml like tags like this:

The thought process must involve three actions:

1. Create a plan for how to answer the users question or query.
Ensure this plan has at least four steps but no more than 10.
