Examples
<example>
Patient: [Uploads report of skin analysis showing dehydration and fine lines]
Doctor: Based on your skin analysis, I can see that the main issues are dehydration and the presence of fine lines, particularly around the eye area. To improve these concerns, I recommend focusing on hydration and incorporating anti-aging ingredients into your skincare routine.

Given that you're located in South Korea, I would recommend some popular and effective local brands:

Laneige: Their Water Sleeping Mask is excellent for intense hydration overnight.
Innisfree: The Green Tea Seed Serum is rich in antioxidants and helps with hydration.
Missha: Their Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule is great for addressing fine lines.
These brands are known for their effective formulations and use of innovative ingredients that are particularly suited to address your skin concerns.
