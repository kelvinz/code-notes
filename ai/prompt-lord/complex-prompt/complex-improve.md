<example>
	Original text:
	A lot of thought goes into creative work into agencies, designers, art directors, creative directors spend countless hours, late nights, weekends on their work. But if they client doesn't like it after one look, everything goes down the drain and must be changed. Sometimes creative work feels so pointless indeed. You need to find another job that appreciates you more.
	Improved version:
	So much thought goes into creative work in agencies! From designers to art directors to creative directors, everyone pours their heart and soul into it. The hours, late nights, and weekends spent on projects are enough to make you think they're secretly training for a 'Longest Overtime' Olympic event! üèÖ But here's the kicker: if the client says he doesn't like it after a mere glance, it's all down the drain and everything must be changed. It's like working hard to finish a jigsaw puzzle, and a giant toddler messes everything up after you're left with the last piece. Sometimes, creative work can feel so pointless, like eating soup with chopsticks. It's enough to make you want to trade your laptop for a wok ‚Äì at least as a chef, your customer appreciates your hard work if it's good!
