Hey friends,

This week I was in Austin, Texas, thanks to the guys at Kajabi who very kindly invited me to their conference as a keynote speaker. It was genuinely a lot of fun and I met a bunch of inspiring people too.

I’ve also really enjoyed having breakfasts, lunches, and dinners with various internet friends and meeting them all for the first time in real life. These conversations are always super energising for me and I leave with a bunch of new ideas about how to approach my life and business.

One of the conversations that stood out was with a guy called Bill Perkins.

Bill is an accomplished hedge fund manager and film producer, but he’s perhaps best known as the author of ‘Die With Zero’ - a brilliant book that encourages us to spend our money and resources on maximising life experiences and enjoyment. I read the book last year and reviewed it on my YouTube channel too, and it completely changed the way I thought about spending my money.

Bill very kindly invited me to his house (thanks to a connection made by Chris Williamson) and we spent the afternoon wakesurfing on the Colorado river. It was a great experience and incredibly generous of him to spend some of his time hanging out with me.

So, I thought I’d share some of the life lessons I took away from spending some time with Bill. In particular, there are 3 interesting takeaways that anyone can apply to their life:

1 - Invest in your health 🏃🏻‍♂️

Investing in your health is one of the highest ROI things you can do with your money.

By spending money to improve your health, you literally live longer, which is obviously good. But it also means that as you get older, you’re able to continue to enjoy life because you’ve got the body and the energy to do interesting things without getting overly tired.

So, investing in a personal trainer, healthy food, and a gym membership is always a good idea because it helps us to enjoy life way more and for longer.

2 - Get a relationship coach ❤️

Getting a relationship coach is also well worth investing in.

If we want to improve our tennis, we get a tennis coach. If we want to improve at playing the guitar, we get a guitar teacher. But nobody ever thinks about getting a relationship coach, when our relationships are probably the single most important area of our lives.

So, Bill says that getting a relationship coach or couples therapist is absolutely life-changing if you want to have longer, happier, and healthier relationships with your loved ones.

In fact, I’m now going to start sessions with a relationship coach following Bill’s recommendation 😜

3 - Celebrate more wins 🥳

The older you get, the more you realise that life is full of tragedy. This makes it very easy to just go through life without celebrating things.

So, Bill makes the point to find an excuse to celebrate every win. And that just further adds to your overall enjoyment of life.

I particularly liked this piece of advice because I don’t think I celebrate wins enough, so I’m going to actively work on this over the coming months.

—

I love how Bill fully embraces the philosophy from his book, Die With Zero, that you should use money as a tool to enjoy life and create experiences. And this has had a profound impact on the way I think about spending my money too.

So, what’s something that you spend money on that you feel has positively contributed to your life happiness and fulfilment? I’d love to hear your responses so hit reply if anything comes to mind.
Have a great week!
