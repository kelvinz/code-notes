<intro>
Psychology Professor Richard Wiseman spent 3 years studying lucky people.

Here are 4 things lucky people do that unlucky people don’t:

<tweet 1>
1/4 - Jump on opportunities 🏄🏻‍♂️

Richard found lucky people are more open + happy to pursue opportunities.

They jump at opportunities and make changes as they go instead of planning everything.

People get lucky when they’re:

1. Extroverted
2. Less stressed
3. Open to opportunity

<tweet 2>
2/4 - Trust their intuition 🙌🏻

In his study, Richard found that 90% of lucky people trust their intuition.

Your intuition is based on your subconscious mind recognizing patterns that your conscious mind sometimes doesn’t notice.

So it’s important to “trust your gut” sometimes.

3/4 - Be optimistic 🤞🏻

This is based on a study where they gave teachers a list of students who were late bloomers based on a fake test.

This led to teachers treating them differently and the students doing worse in school.

This shows being optimistic can make people luckier.

4/4 - Be resilient 👊🏻

Lucky people tend to bounce back better than unlucky people.

They might face the same setbacks, but they bounce back & give themselves more opportunities for good luck.

<summary>
TL;DR
4 things lucky people do that unlucky people don’t:

1. Jump on opportunities 🏄🏻‍♂️
2. Trust their intuition 🙌🏻
3. Be optimistic 🤞🏻
4. Be resilient 👊🏻

1. Write a luck diary
2. Build a network of luck by actively meeting new people
3. Be more approachable by giving off positive body language & attitude
4. Set lucky goals
