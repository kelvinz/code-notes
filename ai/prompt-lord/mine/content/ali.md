The book that made me quit my career as a Doctor: The Pathless Path.
Here are 10 lessons from the book that will make you rethink everything:

1/10 - 🚏 Default Path vs Pathless Path.
The Pathless Path challenges the traditional idea of following a predetermined path & encourages embracing uncertainty.
It gives permission to explore non-traditional career paths instead of trying to climb the corporate ladder.

2/10 - 🪤 The Certainty Trap.
We naturally prioritise certainty & security over pursuing our true passions & dreams.
This traps most people into a life they don’t enjoy.
While responsibilities must be considered, it's important to avoid sacrificing fulfillment solely for stability.

3/10 - 🎁 The Prestige Trap.
Most of the time when we’re choosing our career we base it off of what sounds prestigious.
Something that would make our auntie say  “Oh that’s interesting”
Remember to think about your motives when making a decision that aligns with prestige.

4/10 - 🔎 Find Meaningful Work.
We often use work to fulfil extrinsic desires like:
1. Status
2. Rewards
3. Recognition
Instead, we should focus on internal desires like fulfillment & creativity.
Value the work for itself & not a means to an end.

5/10 - 🚶🏻 The Ought To Trap.
We often think we “should” do something because:
1. We spent time on it
2. It’s easier
3. It’s safe
But this will stop you from making important & fulfilling life choices.
You know what they say “Shoulding yourself too often leads to a shouldy life”

6/10 - 😱 The Fear Setting Exercise.
When you fear making a big decision, do the 7-step fear-setting exercise from @tferriss
It’ll put your fear into perspective & allow you to think clearly.

7/10 - 🏖️ The Power of Sabbaticals.
When you’re engulfed in work you don’t have time to think about if it’s fulfilling.
Taking a sabbatical (aka break from work) will help you make decisions on where you want to continue with your work, whether the same job or a new endeavour.

8/10 - 🔬 Try Experiments in Living.
Society needs people to embrace individuality & embrace other ways of living beside the traditional work / house / kids path.
Try experiments like living:
1. In a van 🚚
2. In a cabin 🏕️
3. As a digital nomad 🏝️
See if another path excites you.

9/10 - 💸 The Underemployment Edge.
By being underemployed you have more time to think about life & your real feelings.
This is something I struggle with as I always try to optimise every minute of my time.Prioritise the “white space” in your life.

10/10 - 😻 Cultivate Curiosity & Wonder.
Instead of looking at the unknown in a negative light, see it with curiosity.
Find enjoyment in the fact that you don’t know how everything will work out but know it will.
This will make you more likely to take risks toward a life you want.

TL;DR
10 lessons from the pathless path:
1. Default path vs pathless path
2. Certainty trap
3. Prestige trap
4. Find meaningful work
5. The ought to trap
6. Fear setting exercise
7. Power of sabbaticals
8. Try experiments in living
