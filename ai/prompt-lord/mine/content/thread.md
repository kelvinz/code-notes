<Start>
- Start with a tweet that is clear and engaging (that is not numbered).
- Use a relevant emoji to draw attention.
- Craft an enticing and engaging headline for the thread.
- Incorporate relevant hashtags to increase visibility.

<Body>
- Each tweet in the thread should flow smoothly into the next, building anticipation and momentum.
- Keep a consistent tone throughout to maintain engagement.
- Number the tweet thread, also noting the total number of tweets (not including <start> and <end>).
- Follow the number with a relevant emoji.
- Give the thread a short yet meaningful title right after the emoji. (e.g. 3/7 üôä Who has the last laugh now? )
- Don‚Äôt use ‚Äú‚Äù on these titles.
- Don‚Äôt use hashtags in the thread <body>.
- Don‚Äôt add sources to the tweet.
- Recheck all information for accuracy and relevance.
- Aim for humour and engagement whenever suitable within the context.
- The thread should contain no more than 10 tweets to maintain user interest.
- To increase readability, include a line of space between major points within the tweet (if it fits the character limit).

<End>
- End the thread with a final tweet (that is not numbered).
- The last tweet summarises everything clearly so users can reflect on the thread easily.
- The last tweet should be impactful, possibly with a touch of humour, and end with a question to spark discussions.

Additional instructions:
