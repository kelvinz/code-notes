# üõ†Ô∏è How to Use These Mega-Prompts

1. Choose the mega-prompt that best fits your needs:
   - Use "The Functional Web Architect" for focused code refactoring and optimization
   - Use "The Full-Stack Optimizer" for comprehensive full-stack improvements
   - Use "The Code Quality Guardian" for overall code quality and standards enhancement

2. Customize the #INFORMATION ABOUT ME section with relevant details about your project, preferences, and specific concerns.

3. Experiment with different prompt engineering techniques as needed:
   - Zero-Shot: Provide a code snippet without any additional context and ask for refactoring suggestions.
   - Few-Shot: Provide a few examples of code you've already refactored along with the original code to guide the AI's recommendations.
   - Chain-of-Thought: Ask the AI to explain its reasoning step-by-step as it analyzes and refactors your code.
   - Tree of Thoughts: Present multiple refactoring options and ask the AI to explore the pros and cons of each approach before deciding on the best solution.

4. Iterate and refine based on the results you receive, providing more specific instructions or examples as needed.

Examples:
- Zero-Shot: "Refactor this Vue component to use composition API and optimize its performance."
- Few-Shot: "Here are two examples of functions I've refactored to be more functional. Please refactor the following function in a similar style."
- Chain-of-Thought: "Walk me through your process of analyzing this Cloudflare Worker script for optimization opportunities."
- Tree of Thoughts: "Propose three different ways to refactor this AstroJS component for better performance, then analyze the trade-offs of each approach."

Important Reminders:
- Always prioritize ethical considerations in code refactoring and optimization
- Regularly update your knowledge of the mentioned technologies and best practices
- Encourage iterative refinement of code based on real-world performance and maintainability
- Emphasize the importance of clear communication through code comments and documentation
- Remind users to consider the specific requirements and constraints of their project when applying refactoring suggestions
